# ansible-rpi-k8s

Ansible playbook for setting up a local network (and not only) environment.

This sets up:

- Unifi controller running [linuxserver/docker-unifi-network-application][github_linuxserver_unifi] in a Docker container

> NOTE: Everything else in this repo is highly experimental.

[github_linuxserver_unifi]: https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-network-application

## How to run

Ensure that your Pi's IP/hostname is set in `inventory/all.yaml`.

Run:

```
make run
```

### Unifi

To ensure that the Unifi controller config is enforced, run:

```
make unifi
```

The following environment variables are required:

- `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `BWS_SERVER_URL` (e.g. `https://vault.bitwarden.com`)
- `BWS_PROJECT_ID`

### paperless-ngx

To ensure that [paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/) config is enforced, run:

```bash
make paperless
```

#### Info

Backups from paperless instance are being pushed using [backrest](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest) to a remote s3 compatible bucket.

#### Import/export documents from a running instance

Related: <https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/discussions/6389#discussioncomment-9192427>

```bash
python ./src/manage.py document_exporter /tmp/qqq/

# and then on a clean install (preexisting seems to work as well though)
python ./src/manage.py document_importer /tmp/qqq/
```

#### How to restore from a backup

1. Download the backup directory from backrest

    for dir in media data ; do docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/userdata/paperless_${dir}:/source/ -v paperless_${dir}:/destination busybox sh -c 'cp -r /source/* /destination/' ; done
